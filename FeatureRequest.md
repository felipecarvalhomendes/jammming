# Feature Request

## Objective
To enhance the user experience by enabling users to verify that a song found is the exact one they were looking for before adding it to their playlist. This feature will provide users with the ability to play and pause preview samples of tracks directly within the search results, ensuring accurate song identification and a more satisfying playlist creation process.

## Background
Implementing the feature to display a play button for tracks with available samples on Spotify addresses multiple user needs and enhances the overall user experience. This section outlines the importance of this feature.

### 1. Enhanced user engagement: 
- **User interaction:** allowing users to preview tracks directly within the app increases engagement and encourages users to spend more time exploring new music
- **Imediate feedback:** users can instantly evaluate whether a track meets their expectations without navigating away from the app or conducting additional searches on Spotify. This streamlined experience can lead to higher user satisfaction and retention

### 2. Research Findings:
- **User preferences:** studies show that users prefer apps with integrated functionalities, such as in-app previews and immediate interactions, which reduce the need to switch between multiple platforms
- **Competitor analysis:** major music streaming apps like Apple Music and Spotify's own app provide track previews, setting a standard for user expectations. By incorporating similar features, our app stays competitive and aligned with user preferences

### Essential functionality:
This feature encompasses the following essential functionalities:
- **Display play button:** a play button will be displayed next to all tracks that have a sample available on Spotify, making it easy for users to identify which tracks can be previewed
- **Play and pause sample:** users can play and pause the sample directly from the search results, offering immediate auditory feedback. This functionality ensures users can quickly decide whether to add a track to their playlist

## Technical design
This section provides a detailed technical overview required to implement the feature of playing preview samples for tracks in the search results. The design will include updates to the existing utility, new component functionalities, component updates, and necessary styling changes:

### Overview
1. **Update Spotify utility:** modify Spotify.js to include the `preview_url` in the search results
2. **Component updates:**
   - 2.1. **Track.js:** import `useState`, add an audio element and play/pause button, conditionally rendered based on the availability of the `preview_url`
   - 2.2. **Track.module.css:** update the stylesheet to style the play/pause button

### Edge cases
1. **No preview URL:**
    - 1.1. Ensure the play/pause button only appears for tracks with a `preview_url`
    - 1.2. If a track does not have a `preview_url`, the button will not be rendered, ensuring no empty or non-functional buttons appear in the UI
2. **Concurrent playbacks:**
    - Implement logic to pause any currently playing preview if a new preview is played. This ensures only one audio sample plays at a time

## Caveats
### Audio playback control
- **Browser compatibility:** different browsers handle audio elements in varying ways. Thorough testing across all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) is necessary to ensure consistent behavior and playback quality

### Resource management
Loading multiple audio previews might impact the performance of the application, especially if users frequently interact with the play/pause functionality:
- **Memory usage:** each audio element created for the preview increases memory usage. Efficiently managing these elements, such as removing them when no longer needed, will help mitigate potential performance degradation
- **Network bandwidth:** continuous playback of audio previews can consume significant bandwidth. Implementing limits on the number of previews that can be played within a certain timeframe or caching audio files temporarily might help reduce network load

### API rate limits
Spotify's API has rate limits that could be exceeded if the application makes excessive requests, especially during high usage periods:
- **Request Throttling:** implementing request throttling or caching mechanisms can help manage and reduce the number of API calls made, preventing the application from hitting Spotify's rate limits
- **Error Handling:** Proper error handling for scenarios where API limits are reached will ensure that users receive meaningful feedback and that the application degrades gracefully without crashing

### Accessibility
Ensuring that the new feature is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, is crucial:
- **Keyboard Navigation:** the play/pause buttons should be navigable and operable via keyboard shortcuts to support users who rely on keyboard navigation
- **Screen Readers:** proper ARIA labels and roles should be used to ensure that screen readers can accurately describe the functionality and state (playing/paused) of the play/pause buttons to visually impaired users
